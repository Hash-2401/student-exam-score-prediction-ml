# Student Exam Score Prediction using Linear Regression

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to predict student exam scores based on study-related factors using a Linear Regression model.

## Dataset Description
The dataset is manually created for learning purposes and contains 15 records.

Input Features:
- Hours Studied
- Attendance Percentage
- Assignments Completed

Target Variable:
- Exam Score

## Model Used
Linear Regression algorithm implemented using the scikit-learn library.

## Results
The model performance was evaluated using:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R² Score

The results indicate that better study habits positively influence exam performance.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of Linear Regression for predicting continuous values.
Feature selection plays an important role in improving model accuracy.
